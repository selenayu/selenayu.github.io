  <h1>List of Good Birds</h1>
  <p>All birds are good birds, so listing all the good birds would be impossible. This list will be instead, a list of <i><b>some</b></i> good birds.</p>
  <p class="important">Please note: birds not mentioned in this list are not any less good than the ones mentioned. These are simply the more common and well known brids. All birds are equally good.</p>

	<tr>
		<td><p>Budgie (Parakeet)</p></td>
		<td><img src="https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/Parakeet-Category-Image-300x300.jpg" class="good-birds"></td>
		<td><p>The budgie (parakeet) is often thought of as a “beginner bird,” however, this social, outgoing little bird deserves just as much care and attention as larger parrots. Budgies are playful, love food and they can rival any parrot in terms of talking ability.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>Cockatiel</p></td>
		<td><img src="https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/Cockatiel.jpg" class="good-birds"></td>
		<td><p>There’s a reason why the cockatiel is one of the most popular companion birds — this slender Australian parrot can be both cuddly and bold. Cockatiels can also be curious and, at times, feisty. With a cockatiel in the house, you are likely to hear a repertoire of chirps and whistles.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>Cockatoo</p></td>
		<td><img src="https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/photo_cockatoo11.jpg" class="good-birds"></td>
		<td><p>Pet cockatoos are often referred to as “velcro” birds because of their highly sociable nature and borderline obsessive need to be around the people in their lives. A cockatoo is a loving but demanding bird.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>Macaw</p></td>
		<td><img src="https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/24067126bgandgwMacaws-300x272.jpg" class="good-birds"></td>
		<td><p>Macaws’ big size and vibrant colors make them hard to overlook. These social birds can create a racket when they feel so inclined, and their clownish ways are sure to draw attention. Although their large beaks can be intimidating, a well-socialized macaw can be a friendly and affectionate companion.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>Caique</p></td>
		<td><img src="https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/18844777white-bellied-caique.jpg" class="good-birds"></td>
		<td><p>Caiques have been called clowns of the bird world for good reason — the clown is a truly appropriate metaphor for this high-energy, medium-sized mischief maker. You haven’t seen playful until you’ve seen a caique in action.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>African Grey Parrot</p></td>
		<td><img src="https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/9549425African-grey-200x300.jpg" class="good-birds"></td>
		<td><p>The African grey parrot’s ability to talk and mimic sounds makes this medium-sized parrot a captivating companion. African grey owners often report that their greys oftentimes talk in context and seem very attuned to their people’s emotions. The African grey parrot is not just a top talker — this bird is also known for its extreme intelligence, which gives them the moniker “The Einsteins of the Bird World.”</p></td>
