  <h1>About This Site</h1>
   <p class="text">What is the first animal that comes to your mind when you hear the term "Good Pets"? Is it a dog? A cat? Or maybe a hamster? 
	  Whatever your answer may be now, it is my goal today to convince you that just like cats and dogs, birds too, can be great companions too! <br>
	  <sub>(Perhaps even better than dogs and cats)</sub></p>
  <p class="text">More often than not, I see people dismissing the possibility of birds being potential companions. To those people, birds are loud, obnixous, and maybe even dangerous (just look at their beaks *gasp*).</p>
  <p class="text">By making this website, it is my goal to show those who feel indifference or fear towards birds that, just like puppies and kitties, birds can become amazing, intelligent, loving pets.</p>
