  <h1>How to Care For a Bird</h1>
  <p class="text">Generally speaking birds are less handful than dogs, and more affectionate than cats, which make them the perfect companion for those who wants to be loved for doing little work (such as myself). However, just because they require less walking and grooming doesn't mean their needs are any less important.</p>
  <p class="text">The first important step to bird care is to know what you are looking for, and what you can provide in exchange. For example, if you are someone who enjoys quietness, maybe stay away from macaws. If you are often away from home, cockatoos may not be the best for you. Additionally, it is also important to consider cage size and financial capabilities. All birds like cages that give them a good degree of movement freedom.</p>
  <p class="text">Birds are highly intelligent animals. With some of the smartest having the same intellgence as a human toddler, they are very aware of their environment and their relationship with their owner. If you make the best effort to take care of them, you will receive endless affection. </p>
